# Data Science Projects

Each project name links to the respective Jupyter notebook. Datasets are available upon request.

### [Project 1 - Analyzing borrowers’ risk of defaulting](https://github.com/krishl/data-science-projects/blob/main/project-1/ds-project-1.ipynb)
#### Libraries used: Pandas, NLTK

This project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. Here we investigate if a customer’s marital status and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness.

The report will be considered when building a credit score of a potential customer. Credit scoring is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.

### [Project 2 - Research on apartment sales ads](https://github.com/krishl/data-science-projects/blob/main/project-2/ds-project-2.ipynb)
#### Libraries used: Pandas

Here we are using the data from a real estate agency. It is an archive of sales ads for realty in St. Petersburg, Russia, and the surrounding areas collected over the past few years. We will use this data to determine the market value of real estate properties. The task is to define the parameters. This will make it possible to build an automated system that is capable of detecting anomalies and fraudulent activity.

There are two different types of data available for every apartment for sale. The first type is a user’s input. The second type is received automatically based upon the map data. For example, the distance from the downtown area, airport, the nearest park or body of water.

### [Project 3 - Analyzing profiltability of mobile prepaid plans](https://github.com/krishl/data-science-projects/blob/main/project-3/ds-project-3.ipynb)
#### Libraries used: Pandas, Numpy, Scipy

Two prepaid plans offered by a state mobile operator will be analyzed to determine which of the two plans is more profitable. The results will be based on the behavior data of 500 clients.
