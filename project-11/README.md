# Building a model to determine used car values

#### Libraries used: Pandas, LightGBM, Sklearn, CatBoost

Rusty Bargain used car sales service is developing an app to attract new customers. In that app, users can quickly find out the market value of your car. We have access to historical data: technical specifications, trim versions, and prices. We will build the model to determine the value.

Rusty Bargain is interested in:

- the quality of the prediction
- the speed of the prediction;
- the time required for training
