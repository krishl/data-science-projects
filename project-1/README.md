# Analyzing borrowers’ risk of defaulting

#### Libraries used: Pandas, NLTK

This project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. Here we will investigate if a customer’s marital status and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness.

The report will be considered when building a credit score of a potential customer. Credit scoring is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.
